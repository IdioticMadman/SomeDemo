ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* lib/
* lib/.svn/
* lib/.svn/entries
* lib/.svn/prop-base/
* lib/.svn/prop-base/json.jar.svn-base
* lib/.svn/text-base/
* lib/.svn/text-base/json.jar.svn-base
* lib/json.jar
* proguard-project.txt
* test/
* test/.svn/
* test/.svn/entries
* test/com/
* test/com/.svn/
* test/com/.svn/entries
* test/com/itheima/
* test/com/itheima/.svn/
* test/com/itheima/.svn/entries
* test/com/itheima/redbaby/
* test/com/itheima/redbaby/.svn/
* test/com/itheima/redbaby/.svn/entries
* test/com/itheima/redbaby/dao/
* test/com/itheima/redbaby/dao/.svn/
* test/com/itheima/redbaby/dao/.svn/entries
* test/com/itheima/redbaby/dao/.svn/text-base/
* test/com/itheima/redbaby/dao/.svn/text-base/ProductDaoTest.java.svn-base
* test/com/itheima/redbaby/dao/ProductDaoTest.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => eCClient_D/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => eCClient_D/src/main/assets
* bin/res/ => eCClient_D/src/androidTest/res/
* res/ => eCClient_D/src/main/res/
* src/ => eCClient_D/src/main/java/
* src/.DS_Store => eCClient_D/src/main/resources/.DS_Store
* src/com/.DS_Store => eCClient_D/src/main/resources/com/.DS_Store
* src/com/alibaba/.DS_Store => eCClient_D/src/main/resources/com/alibaba/.DS_Store
* src/com/alibaba/fastjson/asm/package.html => eCClient_D/src/main/resources/com/alibaba/fastjson/asm/package.html
* src/com/itheima/.DS_Store => eCClient_D/src/main/resources/com/itheima/.DS_Store

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
